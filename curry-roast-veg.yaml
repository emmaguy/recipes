ingredients: 
  - olive oil
  - 6 large handfuls of peeled and diced (3-4cm) root veg
  - 2 heaped tsp cumin seeds
  - 2 heaped tsp coriander seeds
  - 1 heaped tsp fennel seeds
  - 2 tsp ground turmeric
  - 1 large onion - roughly chopped
  - 4 large garlic cloves - roughly chopped
  - 1 green chilli - roughly chopped (use less for less heat)
  - 1 thumb-sized piece of fresh ginger - roughly chopped
  - 1 tin of chopped tomatoes
  - 1 tin of coconut milk
  - 2 cinnamon sticks
  - handful of fresh coriander
  - 1 lime
  - sea salt and freshly ground black pepper
method: 
  - preheat the oven to 200°C
  - put one large or two small roasting tins in the oven to heat up; roots need room to crisp
  - toss chopped roots into a bowl and coat with oil/seasoning
  - add the veg when roasting tins are hot and shake to distribute evenly
  - roast for 45 mins
  - toast the cumin/coriander/fennel seeds in a dry frying pan for a min or two until fragrant
  - mix in the turmeric and set aside
  - put the onion/garlic/chilli/ginger in a blender and purée
  - over a medium-low temp heat a splash of oil in a pan and fold in the spices - fry for a min
  - add the paste and stir frequently for about 5 mins until the paste is soft/fragrant and reduced in volume - add more oil if needed
  - stir in the tomatoes and coconut milk
  - add the cinnamon and simmer - stir constantly
  - season and add in the roasting veg
  - pour the sauce over the roasting veg and bake uncovered for 20 mins until the roots are tender and the sauce thickened
  - at this stage you could add any softer veg e.g. cauilflower
  - finish with lime juice and fresh coriander leaves
  - great with basmati rice/a dollop of yogurt/toasted cashews
